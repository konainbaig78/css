      <p id="head">i saw the sign</p>
      <p id="two">
        and it opened up on my eyes. One of my favourite things to do is to
        caphurethe american nostalgia of signage. They tell us <br />
        where we're going or where we've been. They express a mood or saying can
        even just be a shape. But it's the vintage, <br />
        neon, and big light bulbed signs that say so much more. They aren't just
        your average square shape with letters on it. <br />
        Some actual thought and planning went into the making of the sign. Oh
        and the lost of the advertising with neon signs <br />
        that display motion is always a fun find! Such a lost art in my opinion.
        LED just hurt my eyes...doesn't it?
